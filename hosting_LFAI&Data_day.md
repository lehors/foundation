## Base requirements to host an LF AI & Data Day
1. A 1-day event focused on hosted project(s) or initiatives/workgroups active in LF AI & Data 
2. The event will be hosted by a member company at no cost to the Foundation 
3. The LF AI & Data team in collaboration with the LF Events team will run the events (manage registrations, CFP, agenda building, website, online promotion, etc.) and ensure compliance with LF guidelines and applicable regulations
4.  LF AI & Data Day should not be hosted by non member or part of a larger event
5. LF AI & Data should not be used by organizer to win/gain sponsorship $ for the event
6. The date of the event should not conflict or be close in timing to an LF event that runs an AI track (OSS Summit, KubeCon, AI_dev) so we don't compete for speakers 
7. The LF team needs 3 months lead time to execute. Please send an email to info@lfaidata.foundation to kick off the process before you start advertising the event in your channel
