## Blog Content

The LF AI & Data blog audience is developers and the broader AI, ML, DL, and Data open source enthusiasts. Blogs should be intended to teach and give value to the broader LF AI & Data community.

Blog content should incorporate the following:

* Posts from members must be vendor-neutral. The post may mention a vendor’s name as it relates to specific open source project(s), project deployments, adoption paths, the hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the community, but it shouldn’t feel like an advertisement for the member services or company. We do not accept member or company services announcements or press releases to the LF AI & Data blog.
* The most interesting posts are how-to blogs, blogs with technical content, and those that teach or show how to do something in a way others may not have thought of.
* Blog posts that show hurdles that were encountered and explain how they were overcome often do very well as the community is looking to learn.
* Content on how to choose between different technologies and how to accommodate different legacy issues and platforms is a good way to highlight your learnings and share with the community.
* When showing upstreaming of a patch fixing an issue for others, link back to the Github issue, so readers can follow along.
* Critical commentary or broad issues must be approached with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is beneficial and positive for the community.
* Your post must be your content, but can be published elsewhere with a right to republish. All content should have an author and be published [Creative Commons with Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/), so you’re welcome to re-publish on your own blog.
* Blog length should be no longer than 1,000 words and no shorter than 300 words
* And it is highly encouraged to include at least one image in the blog, such as diagrams, code examples, or photos

Guest authors can add 1-2 sentences at the end of their blog with a link to an external site such as their website or a gated asset. Example best practices:

* Share contact info of author - email, twitter, slack
* Links to company websites
* Links to project websites or Github
* Advertise if they are hiring and who to contact if interested
* The information should not be a link to the LF AI website or form on the LF AI & Data website. The LF AI & Data PR team will review the statement, as is done for the blog content, to approve the author content. If changes are needed, the LF AI & DataPR team will provide suggested edits.

Note: All blogs must adhere to the [LF AI Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).

## Blog Promotion 
Your blog will be shared on LF AI & Data's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LFAI_Foundation) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lfai/) channels.
